# FUNCTION: Allocates memory and reads in a binary file as a matrix of integers
#   If any file operation fails or doesn't read the proper number of bytes,
#   exit the program with exit code 1.
# FILE FORMAT:
#   The first 8 bytes are two 4 byte ints representing the # of rows and columns
#   in the matrix. Every 4 bytes afterwards is an element of the matrix in
#   row-major order.
# Arguments:
#   a0 (char*) is the pointer to string representing the filename
#   a1 (int*)  is a pointer to an integer, we will set it to the number of rows
#   a2 (int*)  is a pointer to an integer, we will set it to the number of columns
# Returns:
#   a0 (int*)  is the pointer to the matrix in memory
#
# If you receive an fopen error or eof, 
# this function exits with error code 50.
# If you receive an fread error or eof,
# this function exits with error code 51.
# If you receive an fclose error or eof,
# this function exits with error code 52.
