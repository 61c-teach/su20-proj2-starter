# =======================================================
# FUNCTION: Matrix Multiplication of 2 integer matrices
# 	d = matmul(m0, m1)
#   If the dimensions don't match, exit with exit code 2
# Arguments:
# 	a0 is the pointer to the start of m0
#	a1 is the # of rows (height) of m0
#	a2 is the # of columns (width) of m0
#	a3 is the pointer to the start of m1
# 	a4 is the # of rows (height) of m1
#	a5 is the # of columns (width) of m1
#	a6 is the pointer to the the start of d
# Returns:
#	None, sets d = matmul(m0, m1)
